## Introduction
B.C. is facing many challenges in the 21st century, such as rising costs of living, housing shortages, health care pressures, climate change impacts, and global competition. To overcome these challenges and build a stronger B.C. for everyone, the provincial government has developed the StrongerBC plan, which sets out two big goals: inclusive and clean growth.

The StrongerBC plan is based on the premise that B.C.'s strength lies in its people, its natural resources, and its innovation potential. The plan aims to put people first by delivering services that make life better for British Columbians, from health care to education to housing. The plan also aims to deliver clean and inclusive growth by investing in skills training, building resilient communities, and positioning B.C. as a world leader in a low-carbon economy.
