# Economic Plan
The economic plan of StrongerBC is designed to put people first, deliver clean and inclusive growth, and build a stronger B.C. for everyone1. The plan sets two big goals for B.C. to accomplish in the long-term — inclusive and clean growth.

## Key Initiatives
* **B.C.’s Intellectual Property Strategy:** This strategy will build the province’s intellectual property capacity by increasing the awareness, use, and protection of intellectual property by startups and small and medium-sized enterprises.

* **Maritime Industries Strategy:** The new B.C. Maritime Industries Strategy will chart the course for a more competitive, modernized marine sector with reduced carbon emissions.

* **B.C.’s Trade Diversification Strategy:** The strategy uses B.C.’s competitive advantage to increase export and investment opportunities in targeted new markets, expand in key existing ones and increase the number and diversity of B.C.’s exporting businesses.

* **Life Sciences and Biomanufacturing Strategy:** The new Life Sciences and Biomanufacturing Strategy will position B.C. as a worldwide life sciences hub nurturing new talent so local businesses can expand and grow, creating high-quality jobs and making it easier for British Columbians to access innovative treatments in clinical trials.

* **Feeding B.C. and beyond:** The new B.C. Centre for Agritech Innovation further positions the province as a world leader in clean agricultural technology, helping improve food security in B.C. and globally, while creating hundreds of well-paying jobs.

* **Building more with low-carbon materials:** The Mass Timber Action Plan reinforces B.C.’s position as a global leader in the production and use of this high-value technology that promises to revolutionize construction at home and around the world.

* **Helping local clean tech companies scale-up and grow:** Through the Integrated Marketplace Initiative, two test beds have been launched in B.C. with an investment of as much as $11.5 million to match local innovators with industry buyers to solve industry problems, while reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.

The StrongerBC plan is a comprehensive strategy for building a stronger B.C. that works for everyone. By putting people first and delivering clean, inclusive growth, the provincial government hopes to achieve its long-term goals of making life better, improving well-being, enhancing prosperity, and advancing sustainability.
