# Climate Action
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with far-reaching impacts on our environment, economy, and society. Recognizing this, the provincial government has developed the StrongerBC plan, which sets out a vision for climate action in B.C.

## Key Initiatives
* **Cleaning up B.C.’s coastlines:** Eight new beach clean-up projects will help to clean 1,400 kilometres of coastline and create 630 new jobs.

* **Protecting B.C.’s natural diversity:** This includes preserving 30% of B.C.’s natural landscapes by 2030.

* **New Energy Action Framework:** This framework will provide certainty for industry, create good jobs, build a clean economy, respect First Nations, and protect the environment.

* **Meeting the demands of a growing population:** Projects like the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant upgrade in Metro Vancouver will protect residents and neighbouring water ecosystems.

* **Growing greener travel options:** An investment of $100 million will expand active transportation networks, and an additional $40 million will support electric vehicle projects.

* **Supporting climate ready communities:** An investment of $1.1 billion will help people to build back better, and secure communities for future climate events.

* **Taking more action to care for B.C. forests:** B.C. is changing how forests are managed and bringing more voices to the table, to put the full health of our forests first.

The StrongerBC plan is a comprehensive strategy for building a stronger B.C. that works for everyone. By putting people first and delivering clean, inclusive growth, the provincial government hopes to achieve its long-term goals of making life better, improving well-being, enhancing prosperity, and advancing sustainability.
