# Safe Communities
Safety is a fundamental right and a cornerstone of any thriving community. However, ensuring safety in communities is a complex task that requires a comprehensive approach. The provincial government has developed the StrongerBC plan, which sets out a vision for building safer, healthier communities in B.C. The plan outlines several initiatives that will achieve this vision1.

## Key Initiatives
* **Repeat Violent Offending Intervention Initiative:** This initiative aims to keep people who commit repeat violent crimes off our streets. It strengthens enforcement, improves monitoring, and meets the unique needs of each community.

* **Protection for Small Businesses:** Local businesses no longer have to pay the full cost of protecting and repairing their shops from vandalism. This initiative provides relief and security, so they can thrive for years to come.

* **Safer Highways with Expanded Cell Coverage:** Better highway cell coverage means people can stay connected, access emergency 911 services, and feel more confident when travelling throughout B.C.

* **Intimate Images Protection Act:** This act gives people new ways to get their intimate images and videos taken off the internet and take back control of their lives.

* **Improving Access to 911:** The plan helps communities upgrade to Next Generation 911 to make it easier for more people to get help when they need it.

* **Enhanced Public Safety Services:** New funding will help specialized units staff up and help protect people in rural, remote, and urban communities all over B.C.

* **More Mental Health Crisis Response Teams:** More mobile crisis teams in more communities mean people in crisis are met early on by healthcare workers and community members.

* **New Coordinated Response Teams:** New units made up of police and dedicated prosecutors and probation officers who will team up to stop violent crime before it starts.

These initiatives will help improve safety in communities, enhance public confidence, reduce crime rates, and support innovation and research in public safety.

The StrongerBC plan is a comprehensive strategy for building safer communities in B.C. By putting people first and delivering clean, inclusive growth, the provincial government hopes to achieve its long-term goals of making life better, improving well-being, enhancing prosperity, and advancing sustainability.
