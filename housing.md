# Housing


Housing is one of the most essential and challenging services that B.C. residents rely on every day. It affects their well-being, their quality of life, and their economic opportunities. However, B.C.'s housing system faces many challenges, such as an aging population, a shortage of affordable and middle-income housing, rising costs, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To address these challenges and improve the housing outcomes and experiences of British Columbians, the provincial government has developed the StrongerBC plan, which sets out a vision for strengthening housing in B.C. The plan outlines several initiatives that will achieve this vision, such as:

* Expanding child care savings to reduce fees for families with children in eligible preschool and before- and after-school child care programs.

* Improving access to fresh, local food by increasing funding for food production and distribution, supporting local food banks, and enhancing school food programs.

* Raising the BC Family Benefit to help people with the rising cost of living due to global inflation.

* Enhancing the Climate Action Tax Credit to help people with the effects of a changing climate and the rising federal carbon tax.

* Providing more help for people facing housing challenges by increasing shelter rates, expanding income and disability assistance programs, and supporting affordable housing initiatives.

* Keeping ferry fares affordable by investing $500 million to keep fare increases low.

* No ICBC rate increase until 2025 to prevent unexpected hikes in basic auto insurance rates.

* No interest on student loans to make education more accessible and affordable.

These initiatives will help improve access to quality and timely services, enhance financial security and stability, reduce administrative costs and inefficiencies, support innovation and research, and create more opportunities for economic growth.

The StrongerBC plan is a comprehensive strategy for building a stronger B.C. that works for everyone. By putting people first delivering clean inclusive growth building stronger B.C . everyone ,the provincial government hopes to achieve its long-term goals of making life better improving well-being enhancing prosperity advancing sustainability â€¦
